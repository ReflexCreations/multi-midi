# Multi-MIDI

A MIDI input box with buffered multiple outputs. This is a device to connect instruments with a MIDI input to, in a star configuration instead of daisy-chained.

Intended functionality is limited: Put through the signal according to MIDI electrical specs, and as a nice to have, indicate MIDI incoming MIDI activity with an LED.
